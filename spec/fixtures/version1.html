<div class="entry-body">
  <p>Hey friends and readers! I&#8217;m interrupting your daily dose of productivity and technology for a quick announcement: Today is my last day as editor-in-chief of Lifehacker.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to keep this (relatively) short and (at least a little) sweet:</p>
<p>I joined Lifehacker in November of 2005 (nine months after its launch), hired by the magnificent Gina Trapani. She was a great boss, and has also become a close friend. Together we built Lifehacker from a small, niche productivity blog into a popular, award-winning site boasting some 5 million readers per month. (We also wrote a book you may like.)</p>
<p>In January of 2009, I took over for Gina, and have been Lifehacker&#8217;s editor-in-chief for the last four years. Our audience has grown to just over 9 million monthly readers. Sometimes cynicism seems like it&#8217;s won the internet, but Lifehacker proves that sincerity never goes out of style.</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t care about how many people read Lifehacker, but you may be interested in where Lifehacker&#8217;s been, and where it&#8217;s going.</p>
<p>If you can believe it, there was no iPhone back in 2005. The most common measure of a good phone was whether it was thin enough to cut things. Technology was, frankly, a lot harder to wrangle than it is now. There wasn&#8217;t always an app for that. As such, Lifehacker&#8217;s best (and most popular) content in the early days involved detailed, step-by-step guides for bending mostly enigmatic technology to your will: Building computers; remotely controlling your home computer; building a Mac (then a very difficult process); writing your own IM bot.</p>
<p>Today, there really is a plug-and-play app that solves most common technological problems. It&#8217;s incredible. Tasks that used to require tedious guides and copying-and-pasting of obscure lines of code now just take a quick installation on your phone and/or laptop.</p>
<p>So, now, Lifehacker has fewer in-depth tech guides; instead, we have more of an emphasis on the life aspect of life hacks than ever. And, even if you carry nostalgia for when things were a lot harder, that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t live to geek; geek to live.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always looked to Lifehacker&#8217;s original tag line to guide the direction of the site, and though Lifehacker has changed significantly over the years, we&#8217;ve stayed true to that premise, and I&#8217;m very proud of everything I&#8217;ve done here and of all the things the staff of Lifehacker will continue to do. (If you want to know more about the origin of Lifehacker, see Gina&#8217;s farewell post.)</p>
<p>As for me: I love building and making things, especially with the help of technology. Apart from the occasional coding side-project here and there over the years (e.g., MixTape.me, Music Plus, Texter, Belvedere, and a handful of other apps), that kind of creation has always been on the back burner while I&#8217;ve been at Lifehacker. So now is the time I indulge the maker in me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m joining a new startup called Superhuman, a yet-to-launch service that, as the name implies, helps people be superhuman. (You&#8217;ll hear more when we&#8217;re nearing launch, but I think you&#8217;ll like it.)</p>
<p>Starting today, Whitson Gordon will take the reins as Lifehacker&#8217;s new editor-in-chief. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll see you around from time to time, whether in a guest post or in the discussion (I hear this Kinja thing is gonna be big). You can also find me on Twitter.</p>
<p>Before I go, though, I want to say thanks. It&#8217;s been a dream job, and I have Gina and Nick Denton to thank for it. (He&#8217;s not as diabolical as you may have heard, or as he would like you to think he is.)</p>
<p>More importantly, I&#8217;ve also got you to thank. Thanks for finding what we do here interesting and helpful enough to keep coming back. Thanks for all your input and support over the years. In a world where nearly every publication has abandoned the idea that comments can mean something on a web site, Lifehacker has always been a place where the comment section is as meaningful and helpful as the posts they&#8217;re commenting on (and sometimes more so).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m truly humbled that you&#8217;ve trusted the work I&#8217;ve done here to guide how you live your life, in ways however large or small.</p>
<p>Pash out.</p>
